# Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

## 📌 Objective
To build a machine learning model that classifies Iris flowers into three species:
Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica.

## 📂 Dataset
The built-in Iris dataset from Scikit-learn is used in this project.  
It contains four features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

## 🧹 Data Preparation
- Loaded the Iris dataset using Scikit-learn
- Created a DataFrame for easy analysis
- Checked basic structure and statistics of the dataset

## 📊 Data Exploration & Visualization
- Inspected the dataset using head, info and describe
- Visualized relationships between features using pair plots

## 🤖 Model Building
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets
- Trained a Logistic Regression classification model

## 📈 Model Evaluation
- Evaluated the model using accuracy score
- Used confusion matrix to analyze predictions

## 🔍 Prediction
- Performed prediction on a new sample input

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ✅ Conclusion
The model successfully classifies Iris flowers into their respective species.
This project demonstrates the complete workflow of a supervised machine learning
classification problem.
